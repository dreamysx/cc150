Given elements (height, weight), sort them both from smallest to largest and get the longest sequence.
Use heap-like structure:

1. sort all elements based on height;
2. say we want to insert element (h,w) to existing heap, 
    we need to find all the leaves (h0,w0) with their w0<w, 
    and insert (h,w) under the one with the longest path,
    and delete all other nodes;
3. if all the w0 in the leaves is >w, 
    then go up and find the first weight <w with the longest path,
    and insert (h,w) under the node,
    then begin to insert next element;
4. after all the elements are inserted, choose the longest sequence and return the ans.
